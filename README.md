# Real description

I've long searched for an alternative to the MacOS-exclusive RTSP player, SecuritySpy, I've never found anything like it. SecuritySpy has been incredibly convenient for me, seamlessly integrating into my desktop environment for monitoring video cameras while allowing me to carry out my daily tasks without any glitches. Its ability to arrange camera feeds neatly in a column, always accessible, is a feature any user would appreciate for its simplicity.

However, being tied to a Windows operating system, I haven't found anything comparable. Every program I've come across has been bulky and lacks the efficiency I'm accustomed to. Frustrated by the lack of options, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create my own solution.

Though initially modest in its capabilities, my homemade player fulfills its primary purpose – providing a seamless experience for monitoring cameras while working on the computer. Moreover, it's now freely available for anyone to use and improve, as it's open source.

This player doesn't aim to be a jack-of-all-trades; its focus is solely on providing comfort and ergonomics. No longer do cluttered camera windows hinder productivity – with this player, monitoring cameras and working concurrently is a breeze. Comfort and efficiency come first in this project, with additional features to follow suit.

I use such video surveillance tools as BlueIris and Frigate, so I didn't forget about them, as well as home automation, the program has integrated MQTT support, so it is possible to receive messages and react to them according to rules that you can create yourself. Whether it's a notification or another action, the app will let you integrate both movements and objects captured by the cameras. For example, if a person has entered the monitored area and the video surveillance system is set to recognize objects, you will receive a message directly on the desktop. Instead of messages it can be Sounds, Led Lights, Baloon tooltips and many more :)
